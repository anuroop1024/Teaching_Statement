\section{Teaching Philosophy}
The opportunity to teach (and learn) from students is one of the key reasons why I aspire to pursue a career in academia. Throughout my life, my teachers have been the foremost inspiration for my academic success, and it has since been my aspiration to similarly serve as a constructive influence on my students. Teaching, to me, is not just about being prepared and organised with the material, eloquently delivering lectures and making yourself available outside class, but it is also about demonstrating to students your genuine passion for the subject, thereby kindling their interest. I always employ the following methods (the 4-Es) to improve the holistic learning experience in my class:
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Explain context before concept:} \par Students learn better if they understand why learn what they learn. I will provide practical applications to various concepts and their significance in real world, making the class both exciting and relevant.
\item \textbf{Emphasise learning not scoring:}\par As a teacher, I will impress upon the students that my objective for them is to internalise the material and not to feel pressured by exams or approach them as a competition. This gives slow-learners the confidence to learn at their pace, promoting inclusive growth in class.
\item \textbf{Evaluate and re-orient:} \par As each class is unique, it is important to proactively refocus the course material and teaching style based on self-evaluation and feedback from students. 
\item \textbf{Encourage open-ended projects:} \par Given the limited time schedule,
it is naturally difficult to discuss all aspects of the topic in class and hence, there is always more to learn
beyond what is taught in the classroom. Also, with the wealth of resources available online and elsewhere,
it is key to give students the opportunity to explore and collaborate through relevant open-ended projects.
\end{enumerate}
Through these principles, I strongly believe that I would be able to effectively deliver the course content and
exceed expectations as a course instructor. I also think teaching would reinforce my understanding of the
subject and my interaction with a diverse set of students can lead to interesting research directions.
